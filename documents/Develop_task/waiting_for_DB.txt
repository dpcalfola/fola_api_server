< The plan is that >
1. Merge all works to develop branch
2. Make branch about this issue and fix it
3. Merge to develop branch and test it
4. If it works, merge to main branch



< The plan as practical >
1. Make Test code for wait_for_db.py
2. Make wait_for_db.py that is django custom command
    2.1 This code is executable as "python manage.py wait_for_db"
    2.2 This code makes delay for 1 second and try to connect to db until it is connected
3. On CI server, run "python manage.py wait_for_db" before run test
    3.1 Finally, CI test command would be "python manage.py wait_for_db && python manage.py test"
